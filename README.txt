The goal of this project is to become familiar with trees and compare the
performance of the self-balancing AVL tree. Also worked with a real world data set and
constructed a generic test routine for comparing several different	
implementations	of the tree container class.


You can compile everything by typing 

make clean
make all

You can compile one program individually by just typing make <Program Name>, for example

make query_tree

By typing 

make clean

You delete all .o files and executables.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To compile on terminal type
  make all

To delete executables and object file type
  make clean

Execute part 2a:
./query_tree	rebase210.txt		

Execute part 2b:
./test_tree	rebase210.txt	sequences.txt	

(i). All parts of the assignment were executed
	-Adding the "big five" and expected methods
	-Parser	to read	in this	database and construct an AVL tree.	

(ii). There are no known bugs in the program
